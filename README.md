This is a Construction Site Simulation for Hololens V2 built in Unity. (Jun 2020 - May 2021)
I implemented a Unity-based (C#) construction site simulation deployed on Hololens. This project is funded by the National Science Foundation on Improving Undergraduate STEM Education. Development including in-game logic and UI logic. Experience mainly include C# and Model-View-Controller (MVC).
